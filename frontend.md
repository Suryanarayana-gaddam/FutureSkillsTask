## React Assignment

1. How can you implement shared functionality across a component tree?
    Using Custom Hooks, Props and global state management libraries.

2. Why is the `useState` hook appropriate for handling state in a complex component?
    `useState` allows you to manage multiple state variables independently within the same component. Ensures that state updates are based on the most recent state, which is crucial for counters and similar scenarios. Keeps state logic isolated and reusable across different parts of the component. Works well with other hooks like useEffect to manage side effects and state dependencies.
    
3. Design a user interface resembling the provided page. Fetch the data from the server and dynamically map the information cards to the fetched data. Ensure that the search functionality is also implemented.
